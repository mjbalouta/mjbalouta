# Hi! I'm Maria João 👾

I'm a graphic designer now diving into the world of software development. I'm currently studying at 42 Porto.
  
I love solving problems and building things that work and that look good (yeah, I think the designer in me will never disappear).
  
I've been enjoying my journey so far! I've been working on a lot of projects and I'd like to highlight the **minishell** project (which is an important milestone at 42) where I got to combine logic, debugging and teamwork. This project really confirmed that I enjoy building things piece by piece, putting in the extra work needed and being mesmerized by the results.
  
I'm currently exploring the idea of becoming a full-stack developer, which would allow me to combine the problem solving and creativity skills.
